# Welcome to my Portfolio Site!

This site is a personal project of mine, where I've created a website to display my experience using various technologies.

Feel free to visit my site at: https://justinhuynh.herokuapp.com/

## List of Techniques Used

1.	SemanticUI was used as the skeleton to build the site's responsive layout.
2.	Node.JS is used on the back-end to enable a more dynamic rendering of the site, as well as in the future for "Contact Form" purposes (WIP).
3.	Express was used in tandem with Node as the back-end framework.

(MAJOR WIP, COME BACK FOR UPDATES SOON!)
