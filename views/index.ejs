					Hey there! My name is Justin Huynh. I am aspiring Front-end Web Developer based in Southern California. My studies began at the University of California, Los Angeles as a Biology major, but through working by trial and error (as most scientists do), I found myself much more interested in the digital field than in the laboratory. Combined with my casual hobby for graphic design and illustrations, I wanted to bring my love for experimentation and learning to the world of digital marketing.
